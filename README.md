### Welcome ðŸ‘‹
This is a chromium based browser extension that accesses the [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/) site and prompts requests as you would if you visited the site.

### **Questions?**
#### 1.How do I use it inside my browser?

1. Navigate to a folder where you want to seve the project to.

2. Press `Ctrl+L`, type `cmd` and press `Enter` if you are using Windows or right-click and press `Open in Terminal` on Linux.

3. Type `git clone https://github.com/Panosfunk/acronym-explainer.git` inside the command line and press `Enter`. This will create a new folder with the project inside the directory you chose to open the command line to.

4. Open your favorite chromium based browser and find a button called `Manage Extensions`.

5. Find the `Developer mode` switch and turn it on. (Usually located on the top right corner.)

6. Find the `Load unpacked` button. (Usually on the top left corner.) This will open a new window. Navigate to the directory where you previously cloned the project to, and click inside the project, then click `OK/Select`.

7. ### Congratulations! ###
You have successfully installed the extension.
